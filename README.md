# Playable Piano

## About
This addon was originally developed by [MacDGuy](https://github.com/macdguy/playablepiano).
At the time of writing this; the addon has not received updates in awhile.

A few minor issues have shown up since then, so this is simply another version of Playable Piano, but with fixes, as well as the source files for the website so that users can host the files themselves.

## Install
Two folders are provided.

|          |                                                                                                                    |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 📁 Server | All files in this directory should be uploaded to your Garry's Mod server.                                         |
| 📁 Web    | Contain website / music notes that players see when activating the piano. Upload them to a webhost. |

For further instructions; view the README in each of the two folders.

## Updates
I released this version just to keep the addon going since it is known and loved by many. I really have no plans on doing massive rewrites to the addon, and am only keeping the heartbeat of the addon pumping.
